    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This Eastern European comfort food dish was inspired by two duck recipes: duck à l'Orange and a Bohemian-style roasted duck. The caraway-scented sweet and sour orange sauce works really well with chicken. Serve on top of traditional Czech bread dumplings alongside sautéed cabbage. Adapted from a recipe by Andrew Zimmern.</p>
